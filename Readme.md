## Worldwide Community

After the first NodeBots event at JSConf US 2013, there was a desire to take the community atmosphere and spread it around the world, ideally engaging many into Node and NodeBots and strengthening the local communities. There are now many NodeBots groups that meet regularly throughout the world.
