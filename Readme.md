## NodeBots Day July 30, 2016

Each year our community around the world gather on a single day to learn and make together. We call this NodeBots Day! This year it's on July 30, 2016

NodeBots Day is not a hackathon. There will be no prizes other than the satisfaction of making something awesome! Each event has experts on hand to help you build your project and start you on the path to building awesome devices. Overall we're going to get together, collaborate and hack. The focus of NodeBots Day is on sharing and enjoying each other's company and JavaScript. Lots of JavaScript.

## Worldwide Community

After the first NodeBots event at JSConf US 2013, there was a desire to take the community atmosphere and spread it around the world, ideally engaging many into Node and NodeBots and strengthening the local communities. There are now many NodeBots groups that meet regularly throughout the world.
