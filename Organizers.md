# International Nodebots Day Organizers

Want to organize a Nodebots Day near you? You should. This is a community event and it will be largely what you make it. A few of us have organized similar events and here we'll share some of the things you'll probably want to pull together and what's worked for us.

## NOTE: Organizer G+ Hangout on 6/23 at 6:30pm US Pacific Time

Follow [@nodebotsday](http://twitter.com/nodebotsday) for details

## The Basics

* Get a space.
    * There will probably be some people who are going to be soldering. Make sure there's an area that's well ventilated for this.
    * Make sure there are enough tables and power outlets/strips for everyone - you'll need enough hookups for computers and robots.
    
* Food, snacks and beverages
    * Warning: this can eat up a lot of your money. This is a great contribution/sponsorship oportunity.
    
* Signup form
    * If you don't need to collect money from anyone, I'd be happy to add a Tito event page for you. Create an [issue](https://github.com/dshaw/nodebotsday/issues) or mention it in the pull request for your event and I'll add you. https://tito.io/nodebotsday/

## Hardware

* Another area where you can sink some money into this event.
* Note that you could potentially run this *totally BYOH (Bring Your Own Hardware)*.
* Bringing in a diverse spectrum of Arduino, Raspberry Pi, sensors, copters, robotic arms, etc makes things fun. Get creative, but above all elicit contributions!
* Not hardware necessarily, but cheap and immensely useful:
    * popsicle sticks of different sizes
    * glue gun(s) and glue sticks
    * spare cardboard
    * exacto knives/box cutters
* Starter kits that may be useful:
    * [MakerShed](http://www.makershed.com/Ultimate_Arduino_Microcontroller_Pack_p/msump1.htm)
    * [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1078)
    * [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11227)
* Discounts
    * Sparkfun Educational discount for NodeBots Day (valid for organizers and participants)

## Recent email that went out to organizers:

Hello Organizers!!

1. NodeBots Day is coming up! 7/27 is the day, hardware hacking is the game. Please be sure to keep up with the repo at https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday. Star it, watch it, whatever. Just try to keep up with the changes so we're all on the same page.

2. The NYC group is hosting an organizer hangout on G+ tomorrow (Sunday, June 22) at 6:30PM US Pacific Time. (I'm sure @buritica will send out the link on Twitter, and a bunch of us will RT it.) Please join us if you can! 

3. There have been many questions about signups/tito.io/etc. Due to a slight misunderstanding of the current state of tito.io, we've got a couple of options:

   - We will give one representative from each location access to the global nodebotsday tito account - we will trust you via the Honor System to not futz with any other city's event page. 
   - We will get you an invite to your own tito.io account.

   Whichever you choose is totally up to you. We have already created event pages for some cities, wherein people have started registering their interest. You'll want to create actual tickets of your own, similar to what the Tri-Cities have done: https://tito.io/nodebots-tricities/2013. For SF, we'll be having multiple type of tickets, i.e. BYOHardware, BYOBeverage, BYOFood. If you decide you want your attendees to pay, you'll have to go with option B. 

   Please let [@rockbot](http://twitter.com/rockbot) know if you'll be going with option A or B. If I don't hear from you by Wednesday, I will assume you're just going to do your own thing ;-)

4. At the end of the day, this is your show. [@dshaw](http://twitter.com/dshaw) has lovingly referred to the entire event as "collaborative anarchy." You can do whatever you like, so please do! We'll share our collective experiences in a post-mortem of some sort (so remember to take notes) :-)

5. Thank you, thank you, thank you for taking charge for your community. This is going to be an incredible event - more details to come!

By all means, if you have any questions, collaborate with the rest of the group via the issues in this GitHub repo.
